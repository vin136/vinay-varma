    "Ok, let me reel back to as far into past I can. I think I don't have the slightest clue during my high school for sure. I used to eat a typical south Indian diet which involves feeding in copious amounts of refined flour(rice, wheat.).And the protein intake is laughable at best. As expected, I used to feel hungry right after eating. I felt good about it. I somehow felt that it translates as growth. During my high-school, especially in the later years, after class 10th, I hardly had time to even surf the internet casually. We were busy preparing for the entrance exam called IIT-JEE(consider them the ivy league of Indian universities just 10 times more competitive). The psychological turmoil during that period is for some other time. I have always had an addiction to reading. I read compulsively. Well, on anything with the slight influence of my mood to steer. That's when I first read Tim Ferriss and some folks on his podcast like peter Attia. I don't remember how I stumbled on the bulletproof guy, but I kind of fancied his books as they seem to have the right amount of 'look I'm different and also right' kind of air about them. So, I picked up on keto and read further. (David Perlmutter-Author of Grain Brain).Well, presently I take two meals a day, with no grains or flours. Unlimited amount of unadulterated foods. (meat, veggies, and fruit) conditioned on availability and taste. Some times I randomly skip meals all day. The next day, I ensure to start with an intense workout followed by a ravenous feeding session. One good rule of thumb is don't eat anything that came into existence in the last 100 years or so and hasn't been before - all packaged and processed foods, sugar."
