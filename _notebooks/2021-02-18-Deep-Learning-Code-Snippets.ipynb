    "Deep Learning is a collection of techniques for finding functions that can approximate arbitrary input-output mappings, while capturing enough structure of the problem to be able to use them in practical applicatons.language-translation systems,Image classification,Movie Recommendation systems are Some notable applications where they have become defacto-choice. This is by no means an exhaustive treatment of the field. Here I provide concise summaries,followed by a simple implementation of some of the most interesting ideas in the field. I believe that many things in the field are unnecessarily complicated by lengthy treatment where a readable code and short explanation will suffice. "

    "Deep Learning allows for learning generalizable mappings between input and output. In supervised setting we are given a `fixed dataset` D = {$(x_{i},y_{i})$},and are tasked to predict $y_{i}$ using $x_{i}$. Thus, we know groud truth for all the input data. This let's us formulate a `loss` that reflects our dissatisfaction with the predicted `outputs` and optimize over it. But, consider how we learn to perform any new task ? The dataset and the learning signal comes sequentially and is also dependent on our actions. We don't have prepared datasets in real life. We learn from experience. `RL` deals with learning under this natural setting. The key difference to note is that the dataset is not `constant`, It changes everytime, contingent on your actions and the stochasticity in the environment. To make this clear, consider learning to play a video game. The pixels (call it `state`) and the score you receive ( call it `reward`) cannot be predetermined until you actually go through the experience. Here the dataset D = {$(state_{i},reward_{i})$} is not same everytime you play the game. `RL` provides a formalism for learning optimal decision making. This will become clear when we see some concrete examples and code. But combing these techniques with `Neural networks` has given us general algorithms that `learn to play atari games`, `beat world champions at Go` and `train robots to learn simple tasks`.\n",

Solving the above problem efficiently requires realizing that `the distance to any node along the shortest path from source to destination is also shortest path`. In the above example the shortest path to `g` should either be through `d` or `f`.(one of the incoming edges). Let the shortest distance from a node `s` to `g` be given by $v^{*}(s)$. Then the last edge of the shortest path should come from evaluating $v^{*}(f))$ and $v^{*}(d)$, where $v^{*}(f) = 1 + v^{*}(g)$ and $v^{*}(d) = min(3+v^{*}(g),1+v^{*}(f))$. This backtracking or dynamic programming approach of finding one edge at a time is illustrated below.\n",

    "In this section we will devolop some theory. First let's define an object called Markov Decision Process (MDP),given by the tuple of $(S,A,P,R,\\gamma)$. Here discounting factor $\\gamma$ is largely a mathematical convenience as it helps to bound the `total reward`. Any reward $r_t$ received at timestamp `t` is multiplied by $\\gamma^{t-1}$, that is we prefer immediate rewards over faraway ones. The term `Markov` refers to the fact that given present state `s` and action taken from there `a`, next state is independent of the past trajectory. Consider the example of `stochastic shortest path` but with the goal state `g` infinitely far away. In that setting we want to maximize the average reward we will get starting from any state.\n",
