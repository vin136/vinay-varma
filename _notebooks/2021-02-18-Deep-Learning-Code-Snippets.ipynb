    "Deep Learning is a collection of techniques for finding functions that can approximate arbitrary input-output mappings, while capturing enough structure of the problem to be able to use them in practical applicatons.language-translation systems,Image classification,Movie Recommendation systems are Some notable applications where they have become defacto-choice. This is by no means an exhaustive treatment of the field. Here I provide concise summaries,followed by a simple implementation of some of the most interesting ideas in the field. I believe that many things in the field are unnecessarily complicated by lengthy treatment where a readable code and short explanation will suffice. "

    "Deep Learning allows for learning generalizable mappings between input and output. In supervised setting we are given a `fixed dataset` D = {$(x_{i},y_{i})$},and are tasked to predict $y_{i}$ using $x_{i}$. Thus, we know groud truth for all the input data. This let's us formulate a `loss` that reflects our dissatisfaction with the predicted `outputs` and optimize over it. But, consider how we learn to perform any new task ? The dataset and the learning signal comes sequentially and is also dependent on our actions. We don't have prepared datasets in real life. We learn from experience. `RL` deals with learning under this natural setting. The key difference to note is that the dataset is not `constant`, It changes everytime, contingent on your actions and the stochasticity in the environment. To make this clear, consider learning to play a video game. The pixels (call it `state`) and the score you receive ( call it `reward`) cannot be predetermined until you actually go through the experience. Here the dataset D = {$(state_{i},reward_{i})$} is not same everytime you play the game. `RL` provides a formalism for learning optimal decision making. This will become clear when we see some concrete examples and code. But combing these techniques with `Neural networks` has given us general algorithms that `learn to play atari games`, `beat world champions at Go` and `train robots to learn simple tasks`.\n",

    "Here taking a greedy approach will fail as actions will have long-term consequences. Solving the above problem efficiently requires realizing that `the distance to any node along the shortest path from source to destination is also shortest path`. In the above example the shortest path to `g` should either be through `d` or `f`.(one of the incoming edges). Let the shortest distance from a node `s` to `g` be given by $v^{*}(s)$. Then the last edge of the shortest path should come from evaluating $v^{*}(f))$ and $v^{*}(d)$, where $v^{*}(f) = 1 + v^{*}(g)$ and $v^{*}(d) = min(3+v^{*}(g),1+v^{*}(f))$. This backtracking or dynamic programming approach of finding one edge at a time is illustrated below.\n",

    "Now, for each action we take, let us also add a `transition probability` that defines the likelihood of ending up in any of the available states given the action. Here, for states `c` and `e` we added some randomness. This will let us model more realistic scenarios. Consider an `RL agent` driving your car. The consequences of any action (eg: Turning the steering to the right given the visual view of the road.) can only be modeled probabilistically.\n",

    "In this section we will devolop some theory. First let's define an object called Markov Decision Process (MDP),given by the tuple of $(S,A,P,R,\\gamma)$. Here discounting factor $\\gamma$ is largely a mathematical convenience as it helps to bound the `total reward`. Any reward $r_t$ received at timestamp `t` is multiplied by $\\gamma^{t-1}$, that is we prefer immediate rewards over faraway ones. The term `Markov` refers to the fact that given present state `s` and action taken from there `a`, next state is independent of the past trajectory. Consider the example of `stochastic shortest path` but with the goal state `g` infinitely far away. In that setting we want to maximize the average reward we will get starting from any state.\n",

    "The only `knob` agent has is policy $\\pi : S \\rightarrow A$.(which of the possible actions to take). The environment dynamics (P and R) are not under agent's control. For simplicity,let's assume that rewards are bounded and positive. Let's say that the agent has a policy $\\pi$ and starts to intreract with the environment. The value function `v(s)` refers to the average reward starting from state `s` and following policy $\\pi$. Then `v(s)` for all the states satisfies a recursive definition as shown below.\n",

    "Thus finding $v^{\\pi}(s)$ amounts to solving system of linear equation or in matrix notation finding the inverse of a matrix. But, we still need the proof for the existence of the inverse for $I - \\gamma.P^{\\pi}$. Before going further, it's important to thoroughly understand the bellmann equation : $V^{\\pi} = R^{\\pi} + \\gamma.P^{\\pi}.V^{\\pi}$. The deriviation involves observing the fact that once the agent takes initial action from state `s`, the transition probability will dictate it's next state `s'`. From there, the average reward by definition is  given by `v(s')`, leaving a recursive definition.\n",

If we recall, a matrix A($n * n$) multiplied by a column vector X ($n * 1$) merely takes a linear combination of all the column vectors in A. Existence of inverse to `A` means that there doesnot exist a non-zero vector X, that can collapse A to a null vector. Using this fact and the traingular inequality on $I - \\gamma.P^{\\pi}$ completes the proof.\n",
