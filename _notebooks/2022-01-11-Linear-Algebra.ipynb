    "Now it is sensible to ask whether by combining two subspaces(UNION,INTERSECTION) can we get another valid subspace. Convince yourself that the `INTERSECTION` of two subspaces is always a subspace which is not the case for `UNION`. If we define the notion `sum of two subspaces` as the collection all elements that can be written as `sum of an element from each subspace`, we note that this set is also a vector space thus a subspace of the original. Also this is the smallest subspace containing both the subspaces (just like how union of two sets in set theory is the smallest set containing both the sets). \n",
