title: Accept all your drives
---
Acknowledge and accept all human drives. The tension between ‘Culturally-accepted’ and ‘evolutionarily-primed’ behaviors create unnecessary fatigue and misery. Evolutionary forces create strong drives that are to be suppressed or accepted based on the imaginative reality of the culture. Breaching those norms leaves us feeling ashamed and guilty. We seek to adjust our thoughts and behaviors to fit into the culture.This often happens in very subtle ways. Mentally note or record in a journal the instances you felt the slightest tinge of guilt or indulged in behaviors that you are not happy. Now, accept that this is by definition is part of human nature. Sometimes mere social baggage creates unnecessary friction against evolutionary drives. Maybe the advantage of sticking to cultural imagination is not worth it. Even, noticing vast differences in the cultural norms across the globe can give a different perspective.Guilt is a bad feeling and it cannot be endured for long. So, our brains invent reasons to escape this feeling.

All behaviours that are against our wellbeing are sustained either by this escape-mechanism or through our complete unawareness of their effects. Only an inquisitive and open mind has the luxury of ever discovering the behaviours in the second category. The creation of the ego is an apt example. Raising our awareness is the only way to open the possibility of improving our well-being.
