It’s a strange realization. There is only now. All our dreams, if realized will have to dawn on some now. There is no escape from now. All the sensations that we derive from indulging in work, thoughts will be experienced now. So the scope of our life depends on our capacity to experience now. It’s a strange realization


Life is happening now. Whether I plan for future, muse on my past or feel the burning pain of my wound , It all happens right now and that’s all I got. A moment arises within the cessation of the previous one. There is no way to latch. In thinking about the future – all my sensations whether the excitement or the dread happens in the present. So it follows whether can I keep myself joyful right now – without the necessity of a person, thing, belief or ideology. That would mean ultimate liberation.
