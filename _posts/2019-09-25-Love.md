A heart brimming with love and a radiant body are necessary to experience life at its fullest. Love doesn’t require anything from outside one’s agency. It doesn’t demand people to be less mean nor for us to constantly look for justification in their actions. It doesn’t arise out of any expectation from oneself or others. Whoever is around you, the habit of having good intentions for their life creates immediate wellbeing. Giving your best to the task, say in playing football for your team, might involve strategizing against your opponent. But, nowhere does it require you to change your intentions. It only becomes a zero-sum game when you rest your source of joy outside yourself – like in winning a game or getting a promotion. Then, inevitably subtle forms of hate arise helping us maneuver through dissatisfaction. But, this leaves us incapable of Joy.
