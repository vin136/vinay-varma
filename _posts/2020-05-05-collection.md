# Intention vs Expectation
There is a subtle difference between intention and expectation. We can have intention without any expectation. Intention comes without any bondage. Expectation pulls us into unnecessary drama – our life will depend on the currents of situations, drawing out life energies. Through intent and purpose, we express ourselves. Life is nothing but an expression of energy.

# Well-being
Seeking acknowledgment and validation from others creates psychological dependency. Longing to be around people arises out of this compulsion to validate. We seek to be cared, respected, included. These primordial drives have kept us alive. All compulsions seem to arise out of a center and work to keep it alive. This is a live process that is happening beneath our awareness. Raising awareness towards this process brings well-being.

# Beyond chatter
We have incredibly complex minds. Capturing it in a Self-image or ego is futile. Ever refreshing attention to the present is all that’s needed to capture the enormity of life. Ego constricts.Beyond chatter, there is a profound experience.

# Inner Exploration
We are our minds.All that we call life arises out of it. Most of the time, our conscious brain runs on auto-pilot – compulsively rolling from thought to thought. Paradoxically, without any force but by just observing these thoughts and sensations as they arise in consciousness seems to have an immediate calming effect. The experience of paying attention to the contents of consciousness brings about fundamental changes in the very perception of life. It would be a disaster to go through life without ever exploring the depths of it.

# Experience
Seek experiences. Personal transformation arises under experiences bereft of any thought or rationalization. These leave a deep impression on us that makes change inevitable. If you fantasize a life of leisure and travel – take a small vacation, Curious about spirituality – take a day off and meditate. We are capable of following irrational group norms based on beliefs and ideals alone. I would rather explore life grounded in reality than led by the figments of cultural imagination. Poke around your boundaries, seek experiences.

# On Impermanence
Thoughts, feelings, emotions, beliefs change continuously. An appreciation of this fact is needed for a balanced life. Almost nothing of me remained from a decade ago…the contents of my consciousness and body have changed completely. But, there is an element in me that stitches a sense of continuity. The grip of the ephemeral loosens when one becomes aware. Not believe or theorize.

# On happiness
It all starts with doubting human condition. Why is it that happiness comes after fulfilling a desire and lasts only for a while? So we are bound to hop from a desire to desire, accumulating whatever angst along the way. Can there be joy untethered to desire ? If not, then a sensible solution would be to have easily achievable goals. This makes the whole hopping thing seem more continuous stream of happiness. But, do we have control over our desires ?

# On Love
We all seem to share a longing to expand. To become more. This drive manifests as a desire for wealth, status, recognition or freedom from all these. Our minds are not satisfied with the boundaries of our physical bodies – there is an element in us that is seeking to be boundless. What is stopping us from loving unconditionally ?

# On Education
Education can be better. A complete human being unsmitten by the relentless need to compare, capable of love is a rarity. When a child passes through a decade or so of education – his capacity towards life should be enhanced. Awareness brings about inner harmony that resolves the need for religion, government, authority, morality. Raising the awareness of our species is the best engineering solution against war, crime, pollution, and self-induced suffering.

# Stretch your limits
Thought is limited to the past. It can’t operate without memory. And memory is limited and fallible. Belief is restricted thought. Collection of beliefs about oneself creates Ego. When a free thought disturbs the certainty of a belief – Ego shatters. Ego feeds on the stability of identity. Seeking to stretch your limits eventually renders Ego useless.

# Joyful life
We are the creatures of limited time and energy. What we choose to make out of these is entirely our choice. Awareness of these basic constants leads to a responsible life. Complete responsibility equals absolute freedom. When we realize our ability to respond to life, events, thoughts will live a joyful life.

# The Vicious cycle
We Sense the world. And then we associate. We then segregate them into good and bad. Any further perception is limited by these associations.
