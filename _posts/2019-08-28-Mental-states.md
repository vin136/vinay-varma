The joy of achievement, the pain of losing a loved one are fundamentally different mental states, invoked under certain conditions. The desired mental states we all seek are similar. In life, we try to line it up with certain mental states while avoiding others. This is the origin of all our desires. So it seems pertinent to find out the controller of these states? From where do they arise ? Does pre-conditions matter to get into a certain state ?
