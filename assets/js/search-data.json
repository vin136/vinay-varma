            "content": "Acknowledge and accept all human drives. The tension between ‘Culturally-accepted’ and ‘evolutionarily-primed’ behaviors create unnecessary fatigue and misery. Evolutionary forces create strong drives that are to be suppressed or accepted based on the imaginative reality of the culture. Breaching those norms leaves us feeling ashamed and guilty. We seek to adjust our thoughts and behaviors to fit into the culture.This often happens in very subtle ways. Mentally note or record in a journal the instances you felt the slightest tinge of guilt or indulged in behaviors that you are not happy. Now, accept that this is by definition is part of human nature. Sometimes mere social baggage creates unnecessary friction against evolutionary drives. Maybe the advantage of sticking to cultural imagination is not worth it. Even, noticing vast differences in the cultural norms across the globe can give a different perspective.Guilt is a bad feeling and it cannot be endured for long. So, our brains invent reasons to escape this feeling. . All behaviours that are against our wellbeing are sustained either by this escape-mechanism or through our complete unawareness of their effects. Only an inquisitive and open mind has the luxury of ever discovering the behaviours in the second category. The creation of the ego is an apt example. Raising our awareness is the only way to open the possibility of improving our well-being. .",

            "content": "Heightened experience of life doesn’t come from grabbing better beliefs and ideologies. Beliefs offer certainty. Our brains are ill-equipped to deal with probabilities. So, a well-formed belief or opinion might serve as a good heuristic. But, Beliefs concerning oneself create an identity.It only creates angst and unnecessary dissatisfaction. It also has the side-effect of pushing life in the background. It feeds on the stability of its beliefs. It works only in the realm of thoughts – It strives to engross and fit everything in its tiny bubble. Any amount of brooding or theorization over this only can burst one to creates newer and more subtle ones. Non-judgemental awareness of this process loosens the hold. At this heightened level of perception, life happens on a different dimension .",

Key Questions : . 1.Can we use neural nets in RL setting where the observations are correlated and Non-stationary(non-iid) ? . solution : Experiance Replay . Context . The key algorithm introduced in the paper is summarized below but we need necessary context before naively implementing it. Let us start with our knowledge of using Deep Nets in Supervised setting, and try to formulate the problem in similar context : . From each state the agent encounters we want the agent to output a probability distribution over all possible actions, which when sampled from results in optimal return. So, if we can have access to the labels(optimal actions) from each state we can easily create a loss function and proceed with SGD over all the states. . Here&#39;s a simple approach for bootstrapping the labels: . Play the episode multiple times. . | Record the returns . | Choose the episodes with highest return. These might be the ones that the agent chanced upon good actions,so train on them. . | Cross-Entropy method . Here we will use gym&#39;s cartpole environment.

            "title": "Collected Thoughts",
            "content": "Intention vs Expectation . There is a subtle difference between intention and expectation. We can have intention without any expectation. Intention comes without any bondage. Expectation pulls us into unnecessary drama – our life will depend on the currents of situations, drawing out life energies. Through intent and purpose, we express ourselves. Life is nothing but an expression of energy. . Well-being . Seeking acknowledgment and validation from others creates psychological dependency. Longing to be around people arises out of this compulsion to validate. We seek to be cared, respected, included. These primordial drives have kept us alive. All compulsions seem to arise out of a center and work to keep it alive. This is a live process that is happening beneath our awareness. Raising awareness towards this process brings well-being. . Beyond chatter . We have incredibly complex minds. Capturing it in a Self-image or ego is futile. Ever refreshing attention to the present is all that’s needed to capture the enormity of life. Ego constricts.Beyond chatter, there is a profound experience. . Inner Exploration . We are our minds.All that we call life arises out of it. Most of the time, our conscious brain runs on auto-pilot – compulsively rolling from thought to thought. Paradoxically, without any force but by just observing these thoughts and sensations as they arise in consciousness seems to have an immediate calming effect. The experience of paying attention to the contents of consciousness brings about fundamental changes in the very perception of life. It would be a disaster to go through life without ever exploring the depths of it. . Experience . Seek experiences. Personal transformation arises under experiences bereft of any thought or rationalization. These leave a deep impression on us that makes change inevitable. If you fantasize a life of leisure and travel – take a small vacation, Curious about spirituality – take a day off and meditate. We are capable of following irrational group norms based on beliefs and ideals alone. I would rather explore life grounded in reality than led by the figments of cultural imagination. Poke around your boundaries, seek experiences. . On Impermanence . Thoughts, feelings, emotions, beliefs change continuously. An appreciation of this fact is needed for a balanced life. Almost nothing of me remained from a decade ago…the contents of my consciousness and body have changed completely. But, there is an element in me that stitches a sense of continuity. The grip of the ephemeral loosens when one becomes aware. Not believe or theorize. . On happiness . It all starts with doubting human condition. Why is it that happiness comes after fulfilling a desire and lasts only for a while? So we are bound to hop from a desire to desire, accumulating whatever angst along the way. Can there be joy untethered to desire ? If not, then a sensible solution would be to have easily achievable goals. This makes the whole hopping thing seem more continuous stream of happiness. But, do we have control over our desires ? . On Love . We all seem to share a longing to expand. To become more. This drive manifests as a desire for wealth, status, recognition or freedom from all these. Our minds are not satisfied with the boundaries of our physical bodies – there is an element in us that is seeking to be boundless. What is stopping us from loving unconditionally ? . On Education . Education can be better. A complete human being unsmitten by the relentless need to compare, capable of love is a rarity. When a child passes through a decade or so of education – his capacity towards life should be enhanced. Awareness brings about inner harmony that resolves the need for religion, government, authority, morality. Raising the awareness of our species is the best engineering solution against war, crime, pollution, and self-induced suffering. . Stretch your limits . Thought is limited to the past. It can’t operate without memory. And memory is limited and fallible. Belief is restricted thought. Collection of beliefs about oneself creates Ego. When a free thought disturbs the certainty of a belief – Ego shatters. Ego feeds on the stability of identity. Seeking to stretch your limits eventually renders Ego useless. . Joyful life . We are the creatures of limited time and energy. What we choose to make out of these is entirely our choice. Awareness of these basic constants leads to a responsible life. Complete responsibility equals absolute freedom. When we realize our ability to respond to life, events, thoughts will live a joyful life. . The Vicious cycle . We Sense the world. And then we associate. We then segregate them into good and bad. Any further perception is limited by these associations. . Discipline . It takes some effort to stick to a regimen. But it’s the only way to transform oneself. A sense of personal growth seems to be very fundamental for a good life. We all have this longing to expand and grow beyond ourselves. Whatever the means one may choose, discipline is the tool. . Keep it simple . Life is simple. Catch yourself, whenever you are trying to make it otherwise. Do not escape reality. Acknowledge your feelings and desires without judgment. Do not hurry. There is no compulsion to reach conclusions. Appreciate uncertainty. We can take better actions under this framework. Forcing reality is a loser’s game. Keep it simple. . Pay the dues . Pay attention to your desires and fears. We are complex creatures. Often we are unsure of what we want. It takes deliberate struggle to evade dissatisfaction and boredom. So let it be. Pay the dues. . Take Charge . Imagine. Consciously, not impulsively imagine what your ideal life should be like. Imagine freely, the kind of family, the nature of work and the world you would like to live in.Feel it to the bone. Now, do What you should be doing today to move in that direction. You can either live intentionally or succumb to the compulsive desires sold to you. There is always somebody dictating you the norms, selling you their fears and insecurities. Taking charge involves paying enough attention to these superficial desires, so they lose their grip. To connect with your deepest longings, you need to imagine freely and act. The feedback can only come through action. So, it’s better to imagine yourself, take charge and act. . Anger . It’s absorbing. But, it damages both the ends. The physical sensations are not pleasurable,often the actor feels more pain than the recipient. A moment’s awareness settles everything down. Somewhere along the line,control is being dropped. It is a fun exercise to actively take note of these situations , and seek to involve in them. To non-judgmentally observe your response. It becomes impossible to be both conscious and angry. .",

            "title": "Thoughts on Building Things",
            "content": "Start early, start now . Start early. Wherever you are, now is the time. Those who made it might not tell you but luck is a big factor. The earlier you start, the more can you fail. It’s an odd’s game. Don’t be fooled by the myth of ‘Genius’ nor the ‘Hard work’. Cowards subscribe for ‘the genius’ while the winners and aspiring ones go for ‘the ‘Hard work’.Both are overly result-oriented. Planning for the worst and giving your all is the name of the game. And having time on your side lets you play it for a tad longer. Start now. . Intensity, at will . Spend some time with yourself. Remove all the distractions – thoughts, compulsions. Cultivating a craft where you can be completely absorbed, will open up a new dimension. When you remove distractions, life intensifies. This percolates into all areas of life. You will become capable of intensity, at will. . Nobody to please . Learn to disagree. Compulsively worrying to satisfy and please others at the stake of personal wellbeing is a pathological condition. Being spiteful and nasty is not an option. But, not negotiating for your well-being is pathetic. Over time, the effects percolate. Personal beliefs are altered to fit the reality. True capacities are shunned and never realized. Agreeable people are paid less. Their position in social hierarchy remains mediocre. There is no moral obligation to please anybody. . Create a routine . Create a routine. Else you will be put in one. Exercise your freedom to choose what you want to do. Repeating the same steps every day is the only way to gain mastery. It is by building this reservoir of work you can sustainably stick with it. This is your ticket to freedom. Uncommitted become the slaves of norms. They will always be struggling to escape, always at odds with reality. start with your body. Have an exercise routine that can be maintained. Next, Work. Choose what you want more of and create a routine around it. Do not be tempted to fit too much here. Slowly you will develop expertise and confidence that will let you do more of it. . The most important thing . Cultivate the ability to break-down complex problems into simpler ones. This is the meta-skill that translates into greatness in every field. Accomplishing ridiculously difficult tasks demands the ability to visualize the composing sub-tasks and formulate daily routines around them. On any day, there should always be one thing that takes your complete attention, irrespective of the breadth of the project. As an entrepreneur, your sole responsibility is to answer what is the most important thing, now ? . On work . Selling time for money is addictive. It nullifies the odds of accumulating wealth. It makes one blind to possibilities, incapable of imaging the power of leverage. Aspiring entrepreneurs should never work for money. They should actively avoid fixed pay contracts. Only under the circumstance of receiving rare skill, knowledge can they transact their time. Actively seek mild discomfort. Once succumbed to the safety of a job, anything creative sounds dangerous and implausible. The closer you can be to the creative process, the better. For employment, Startups are the best bet. Manipulating your environment is the most direct way of influencing outcomes. Under no circumstance, your time should be spent away from the creative process. There are always better options. . Luck . There is a controllable element to what people refer to as Luck – being in the right place at the right time. Depending upon what you want to do, there are great places(people) around the world. Anything that can structurally avoid complacency, is a great choice. We should look for as much discomfort as possible and the most sensible way is to place yourself in a hard place with hard people. . Consistency . Don’t directly rush into doing something. Take some time and put some labor to find out why you want to create something. Only when you are clear on Why proceed further. The next important question is what you can do right now to get a bit closer? Daily commitments should be so simple that they sound laughably easy.This ensures momentum, as we achieve them daily. We are not naturally good at forecasting the cumulative effects of simple habits. The key to accomplishing ridiculously difficult tasks is consistency, not the quantum of work done on a day. . Progress . Clarity of what you want in the long term is absolutely crucial. Define it. Take some time and write it down. Yes, it might evolve. But you should have a clear understanding of the essence. Ask specific questions like How do you want your day to be? How does your ideal work environment look like? How does your relationships, health, financials look like? Create a practice to develop deeper understanding of your longings? Only with clarity of vision can there be a possibility of progress. . Hard Work . Working more hours is not hard work. Putting your heart to create something is not hard work. Constantly stretching your capabilities is not hard work. Taking responsibility is not hard work. Working for the paycheck, bearing and accepting the inanity of your work, waiting for the weekend, passing through life without intensity is Hard Work. . Every Day . Focus on what you are doing every day. Start with the smallest change that can be incorporated into your routine. Now stick to it every day. This is the secret of accomplishing impossibly difficult tasks. Focus on the routines and habits. Nothing more is needed. . Fear is good . When you are starting something new, the fear of failure is often useful. This forces you to focus on risk. Being able to use this fear to ask the right questions, to strategies and come up with novel ideas is the defining skill of a successful entrepreneur. In the right proportions, it illuminates threats, directs the energies. Fear is good. . Copying Ideas . Don’t get lost in the “next big idea” fallacy. There are two practical ways to come up with successful business ideas. Look for the problems you are facing or Copy from the solutions other entrepreneurs successfully implemented. The first category involves listing down all the activities in your day while thinking how each one of them can be made better. Now, once you choose a few, write down how much you are willing to pay and the kind of service or the product you want. If an idea filters through this process successfully, it can be considered further. Don’t fool yourself here,if you aren’t willing to pay chances are nobody will. The second category is much simpler. Choose an industry. (better you already got some idea about it.).Now find out what’s happening within it in other countries. Read their magazines, news sites, etc. Now the question boils down to, What successful business products and models can you take inspiration from? Yes, that’s called copying ideas. Hopefully, you are doing all this to create some value, not justify your genius. . Little by little . We lack the ability to foresee the effects of small changes accumulated over time. Habits are remarkable ways to leverage the power of compounding. Introspect how your daily time is spent. Add or substitute a habit at a time. There is no hurry. This is a long term game. Keep the changes to absolute minimum.In the initial stages, momentum is the key. Whatever your ideal time or effort, reduce it by half – this should be your initial commitment. When creating habits, setting ridiculously easy goals so that it’s impossible to fail is the key. Consider any extra effort put as the bonus and feel great about it. Little by little your life will be transformed. . Attention . Attention is limited. Any practice or technique that allows you to direct your energies will have a compounding effect on your life. Measure your day by how much of it is intentional. There are always people and things constantly attempting to grab your attention – the News, Internet, fancy toys. It’s a skill that can be trained. .",

Whoever is around you, the habit of having good intentions for their life creates immediate wellbeing. Giving your best to the task, say in playing football for your team, might involve strategizing against your opponent. But, nowhere does it require you to change your intentions. It only becomes a zero-sum game when you rest your source of joy outside yourself – like in winning a game or getting a promotion.

Life is happening now. Whether I plan for future, muse on my past or feel the burning pain of my wound , It all happens right now and that’s all I got. A moment arises within the cessation of the previous one. There is no way to latch. In thinking about the future – all my sensations whether the excitement or the dread happens in the present. So it follows whether can I keep myself joyful right now – without the necessity of a person, thing, belief or ideology. That would be cool. .",
